## Description:

This is a UI dashboard over Evolution Graph Dataset offering capabilities to realize similarity and origins between species. 

Evolution of Species - studied by Darwin follows connected graph structure. Here, we've built the dataset on Neo4j using Species as nodes
and Category linkage as relationships. For user ease, a JS/SCSS/bootstrap dashboard app is built over neo4j dataset.

## Demo:

## Spec:

### Database:
- *Data Source:* https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org
- *Representation:* Evolution is normally described as [Phylogenetic tree](http://phylot.biobyte.de). For tabular representation, taxonomy is created.
Our graph is generated using tabular representation.
- *Size:* 85205 species * 6 levels of categorization resulting into 113k nodes and 400k edges
- *Model:*

### UI dashboard:
- Scripting: JS
- Graph Visualization: d3js
- Neo4j connector: neo4j-driver library
- Styling: SCSS, Bootstrap
- Package: npm
- Build: webpack
